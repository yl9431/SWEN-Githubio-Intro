## Yi Xhan Lin

```markdown
  Hello, I am Yi Xhan Lin. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I went to John Dewey High School, and I enjoy 
playing video games in my free time. Even though I say that, I spend most of my time watching youtube. I also like to spend 
time with friends doing nothing in particular.

I think this is the right RIT SE website:

Some things I would like to learn in this class are:
- What does a software engineer do?
- What are some of the people we will work with
- The different jobs a software engineer could take
